Take a list of hotels with latitude and longitude,
figure out N closest hotels (on hotel) for each hotel.

Hotel list takes form col_1 = 'hotel_id', col_2 = 'longitude', col_3 = 'latitude'

Adjust .csv file read and N hotels listed at bottom of script

## To-do:
* may adapt to make a module which can be run as script from command line
